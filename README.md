### Ebuddy - Your Best Virtual Friend

It was published on the website "infinityfree". They provided me with the domain name and hosting location once I registered an account and logged in with this account. To begin, I created a database called "epiz 30687938 ebuddy" and uploaded all of our database tables to it. I modify the security password for the database after uploading my entire "e buddy 5" project code to File Manager's htdocs directory.
